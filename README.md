# Ansible Role: Homebrew

Installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS or Linux, and configures taps, packages and casks. Package uses retry loops to deal with connectivity issues.

If you **like/use** this role, please consider **starring** it. Thanks!

<br>

## üìë Requirements

None.

<br>

## üîß Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with example values (see `defaults/main.yml`). Additional variables are stored in `vars/main.yml`.

<br>

### ‚Üí Structure

Github repository variable for Homebrew core. By default role checks for latest release from official Homebrew repository, if you are changing `homebrew_repository` to your  fork and want to use `master` branch and turn off latest release autodetect, then set `homebrew_repository_use_master` variable to `true`

```yaml
# From which repository should we install homebrew?
homebrew_repository: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew

# Set to true if you want to use master branch instead of release auto detect,
# or you use custom fork specified in homebrew_repository
homebrew_repository_use_master: false
```

When set to true, will update Homebrew itself and upgrade all homebrew packages:

```yaml
# Run task to upgrade all packages
homebrew_upgrade_all: false
```

Variables controls retry times and delay to wait between retries, if `homebrew install` task failed:

```yaml
# How much times to retry, if installation of package / tap / cask fails ?
# This can happen during network problems.
homebrew_retries: 32

# Delay between each retry attempt.
homebrew_delay: 3
```

Set to `true` to remove the Hombrew cache after any new software is installed or updated.

```yaml
homebrew_clear_cache: false
```

Directory where applications installed via `cask` should be installed.

```yaml
homebrew_cask_appdir: /Applications
```

If set to `true`, passes `--greedy` to brew cask outdated when checking if an installed cask has a newer version available.

```yaml
homebrew_cask_greedy_mode: false
```

Turn off homebrew analytics, which are collected by default.

```yaml
homebrew_collect_analytics: false
```

  # tap with defined custom state
  - name: homebrew/cask-fonts
    state: present
```

**Removing** taps:

```yaml

## üß™ Testing

For local testing you can use these comands to test whole role or separate tasks:

> :warning: **Notice**: By defaut all tests are ran against your local machine!

```bash
# run all tasks in role
$ make test

# run idempotency check
$ make test-idempotent

# or test-tag without any parameters
$ make test-tag

# run tasks that ensures brew installation on macos
$ export TASK_TAGS="brew-install"; make test-tag

# run tasks that tries to update brew
$ export TASK_TAGS="brew-update"; make test-tag

# run tasks that tries to update brew and then run taps and casks
$ export TASK_TAGS="brew-update brew-taps brew-casks"; make test-tag
```

Full list of commands can be seen in `Makefile`.
