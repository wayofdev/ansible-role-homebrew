## üìë Requirements

* Up-to-date version of ansible. During maintenance/development, we stick to ansible versions and will use new features if they are available (and update `meta/main.yml` for the minimum version).
* Compatible OS. See [compatibility](#-compatibility) table.
* `jmespath` library needs to be installed on the host running the playbook (needed for the `json_query` filter).
* Role has dependencies on third-party roles on different operating systems. See `requirements.yml` and [dependencies](#-dependencies) section.

<br>

## üîß Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with example values (see `defaults/main.yml`). Additional variables are stored in `vars/main.yml`.

<br>

### ‚Üí Structure

Github repository variable for Homebrew core. By default, role checks for latest release from official Homebrew repository, if you are changing `homebrew_repository` to your  fork and want to use `master` branch and turn off latest release autodetect, then set `homebrew_repository_use_master` variable to `true`

```yaml
# From which repository should we install homebrew?
homebrew_repository: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew

# Set to true if you want to use master branch instead of release auto-detect,
# or you use custom fork specified in homebrew_repository
homebrew_repository_use_master: false
```

When set to true, will update Homebrew itself and upgrade all homebrew packages:

```yaml
# Run task to upgrade all packages
homebrew_upgrade_all: false
```

Variable controls retry times and delay to wait between retries, if `homebrew install` task failed:

```yaml
# How much times to retry, if installation of package / tap / cask fails ?
# This can happen during network problems.
homebrew_retries: 32

# Delay between each retry attempt.
homebrew_delay: 3
```

Set to `true` to remove the Hombrew cache after any new software is installed or updated.

```yaml
homebrew_clear_cache: false
```

Directory where applications installed via `cask` should be installed.

```yaml
homebrew_cask_appdir: /Applications
```

If set to `true`, passes `--greedy` to brew cask outdated when checking if an installed cask has a newer version available.

```yaml
homebrew_cask_greedy_mode: false
```

Turn off homebrew analytics, which are collected by default.

```yaml
homebrew_collect_analytics: false
```

<br>

### ‚Üí Tapping repositories

**Adding** (tapping) repositories

```yaml
homebrew_taps:
  - homebrew/core
  - homebrew/cask-versions
  - homebrew/cask-fonts
```

**Adding** (tapping) repositories, in more verbose way, defining urls and states:

```yaml
homebrew_taps:
  # just tap
  - name: homebrew/core

  # tap from custom repository
  - name: denji/nginx
    url: https://github.com/denji/homebrew-nginx

  # tap with defined custom state
  - name: homebrew/cask-fonts
    state: present
```

**Removing** taps:

```yaml
homebrew_taps:
  # define state: absent to delete taps
  - name: homebrew/cask-fonts
    state: absent

  - name: denji/nginx
    state: absent
```

<br>

### ‚Üí Packages: Installing, updating and removing

**Adding** packages in simple way:

```yaml
homebrew_packages:
  - wget
  - curl
  - nano
```

**Adding** packages in advanced way, defining state, path, and other options:

```yaml
homebrew_packages:
  # install to custom path
  - name: wget
    state: present
    path: /opt/custom/path/bin
```

**Updating** packages:

```yaml
homebrew_packages:
  # update homebrew first and install formula wget with 'brew' in default path
  - name: wget
    state: present
    update_homebrew: true

  # update homebrew first and upgrade formula curl to latest available with 'brew' in default path
  - name: curl
    state: latest
    update_homebrew: true
```

**Removing** packages:

```yaml
homebrew_packages:
  - name: wget
    state: absent
  - name: curl
    state: absent
```

<br>

### ‚Üí Casks: installing, updating and removing

> :warning: **Notice**: Casks are supported only on macOS. See [this post](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew/issues/742).

**Adding** casks in simple way:

```yaml
homebrew_casks:
  # Installing list of casks
  - firefox
  - google-chrome
  - alfred
  - 1password
```

**Adding** casks with advanced options:

```yaml
homebrew_casks:
  # Installing firefox cask
  - name: firefox
    state: present
```

**Removing** casks:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

To install dependencies and start development you can check contents of our `Makefile`

**Install** [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) using [poetry-bin](https://github.com/gi0baro/poetry-bin) and all dev python dependencies:

```bash
$ make install
```

**Install** only python dependencies, assuming that you already have poetry:

```bash
$ make install-deps
```

**Install** all git hooks:

```bash
$ make hooks
```

**Lint** all role files:

```bash
$ make lint
```

<br>

## üß™ Testing

For local testing you can use these comands to test whole role or separate tasks:

> :warning: **Notice**: By defaut all tests are ran against your local machine!

```bash
# run all tasks in role
$ make test

# run idempotency check
$ make test-idempotent

# or test-tag without any parameters
$ make test-tag

# run tasks that ensures brew installation on macos
$ export TASK_TAGS="brew-install"; make test-tag

# run tasks that tries to update brew
$ export TASK_TAGS="brew-update"; make test-tag

# run tasks that tries to update brew and then run taps and casks
$ export TASK_TAGS="brew-update brew-taps brew-casks"; make test-tag

# run by tag
$ make test-install
$ make test-analytics
$ make test-update
$ make test-taps
$ make test-packages
$ make test-casks

# run molecule tests
